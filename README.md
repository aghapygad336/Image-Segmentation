# Assignment(Image Segmentation): 
Image segmentation is the classification of an image into different groups. Many researches have been done in the area of image segmentation using clustering. There are different methods and one of the most popular methods is k-means clustering algorithm. K -means clustering algorithm is an unsupervised algorithm and it is used to segment the interest area from the background.

# Berkeley Segmentation Data Set and Benchmarks 500 (BSDS500):

Best Practice Guidelines: The dataset consists of 500 natural images, ground-truth human annotations and benchmarking code. The data is explicitly separated into disjoint train, validation and test subsets. In order to preserve the integrity of the evaluation and obtain a direct and fair comparison of your results with existing methods
